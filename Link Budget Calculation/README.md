"A link budget is a design aid, calculated during the design of a communication system to 
determine the received power, to ensure that the information is received intelligibly 
with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio" (Wikipedia)

Link budget calculation

1)
The link between a Mobile Network transmitter and a mobile phone receiver has the 
following parameters. Assuming simple line-of-sight propagation occurs, 
calculate the power received at the output of the receive antenna.

Carrier frequency (CenterFreq=2.1 GHz)
EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power = 500 W)
Path distance (R = 10 km)
Transmit antenna gain (TxGain = 3dB)
Receive antenna gain (RxGain = 10dB)


Calculated parameters

Wavelength of transmitted signal = 0.142 m
Transmitted power = 54dBm
Path Loss = -118.94 dB
Power received at the output = -51.94dBm

The system is designed and simulated using keysight ADS.


2)
Calculate the received IF signal power for a satellite TV system with the following
parameters:

Geostationary satellite distance 40,000 km
Transmit frequency 12 GHz
Transmit power 100 W
Spacecraft antenna diameter 2m
Atmospheric absorption 2dB
Receiver antenna diameter 0.6m
LNA gain 30 dB
Mixer conversion loss 10dB
Receiver IF frequency 1 GHz
Antenna efficiencies 60%

Calculated parameters

Wavelength of transmitted signal = 0.025 m
Transmitter gain = 45.79 dB
Receiver gaiin = 35.3 dB
Transmitted power = 50 dBm
Path Loss = -206.1 dB
Power received at the output = -56.96 dBm

The system is designed and simulated using keysight ADS.
